<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Statistical modelling</h1>
<p>Was Paul truly psychic, an oracle of some kind? Or was Paul – or his keeper, as what does fame really mean to an octopus? – just really lucky? How do we know? And what really are the chances of predicting the winner of 8 matches correct? These are questions we will focus on now.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will start defining statistical models and using them to make inferences about the Data Generating Process. We will cover some basic probability theory, and use this to define two alternative models of Paul’s predictions. One in which he is randomly guessing, and one in which his predictions can be more (or less) accurate than if he were randomly guessing, while we are unsure about how accurate Paul really is in that case. We will discuss how to estimate the unknown accuracy of Paul’s predictions in this model. After this. we will try to answer the question: was Paul (somewhat) psychic? Our answer will be based on whether we can refute the hypothesis that he was randomly guessing. This is generally done with a procedure called a null-hypothesis significance test. We will also consider another way in which to look at this, in the form of so-called confidence intervals.</p>
<div id="coin-flipping-defining-a-statistical-model" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Coin flipping: Defining a statistical model</h2>
<p>What does it mean for Paul to be psychic, to be an oracle? Sometimes it is easier to answer this question by considering the opposite: When would Paul <em>not</em> be an oracle? If Paul had no way to tell the future, he would be “merely guessing”. Purely random guessing between two options can be implemented by flipping a coin. Suppose Paul made his choices by “flipping a mental coin”, and choosing the box on the left when the outcome was “heads”, and the box on the right when the outcome was “tails”. Great, we now have a model of the Data Generating Process! Coin flipping can be seen as a physical model. It is something that we can do in the real world, as many times as we want. Because we understand the physical properties of coin flips reasonably well – it is really difficult to predict the outcome of a coin flip – it works well as a model of random guessing. But flipping coins over and over is rather tedious. If we have a mathematical description, a statistical model, of flipping coins, we can spare ourselves this trouble. To do so, we first need to know a bit more about probability.</p>
</div>
<div id="probability" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Probability</h2>
<p>Let’s simulate Paul’s decisions for the FIFA world cup. Grab a coin and flip it 8 times. What are the outcomes? When I did this, the outcomes were:</p>
<p>tails, tails, tails, heads, tails, heads, heads, tails</p>
<p>Remember, Paul would go left upon heads, and right upon tails. Following these rules, Paul’s decisions are then:</p>
<p>right, right, right, left, right, left, left, right</p>
<p>To know whether these guesses are correct or incorrect, we need to know which team was placed in which box. This information is provided in Table <a href="intro.html#tab:fifa2010">1.2</a>: the first country under <code>Match</code> is the box on the left, and the second the box on the right. Using this, our simulation then provides the following:</p>
<p>incorrect, correct, correct, correct, correct, correct, incorrect, correct</p>
<p>So in our simulation, Paul made 6 correct predictions out of 8. Not quite as good as the real Paul, but still a reasonable performance.</p>
<p>Notice how we went through quite a few steps. We defined a model of non-psychic-and-guessing Paul as making decisions by flipping a coin, we then simulated Paul’s decisions by flipping a coin, then transformed these coin flips into a variable containing the decisions to open the left or right box, and finally transformed this variable into another variable containing the accuracy of the predictions. The first transformation is easy. We could have simply put stickers on the coin relabelling “heads” as “left” and “tails” as “right”. The second transformation is not as obvious as it depends on a second variable (whether the winning team was represented by the left or right box). In this case, we could have saved ourselves a bit of work by immediately relabelling our coin flips as “correct” or “incorrect”. To see why, we need to know a bit more about how to calculate probabilities.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the beginning. For one coin flip, there are two possible outcomes: the coin lands on heads or on tails. The outcome can’t be neither (we are assuming the coin is thin enough to not land on its side), nor two heads, or something else. The coin must land on either heads or tails, so there are two outcomes. We call the set of all possible outcomes the <strong>outcome space</strong>, and we’ll use a nice curly <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> to denote it:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{S} = \{\text{heads},\text{tails}\}\]</span></p>

-->
<p>Our coin flip is a <strong>random variable</strong> that takes one of the values in the outcome space. It is traditional to denote random variables with capital Roman letters, and the values with small Roman letters. When we want to make generic statements that apply to different random variables (such as a coin flip, the roll of a die, the outcome of a prediction), we tend to use this notation, and <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=y)\)</span> then means ‘The probability that random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>’. Other times, it may be easier to use more descriptive names. In this book, when we use a name for a variable, we will use a computer font, such as <code>coin_flip</code>, for the random variable. So <span class="math inline">\(P(\texttt{coin\_flip} = \text{heads})\)</span> means ‘The probability that random variable <code>coin_flip</code> has the value “heads”’.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> What is probability?</h3>
<p>I have just introduced the word “probability” without telling you what it means. You probably have some intuition yourself, for instance that probability is the chance of something happening. You might be surprised to know that even though statisticians can all perform probability calculations comfortably, there is quite some disagreement on what probability means. According to the traditional, <strong>Frequentist view</strong>, probability means <em>long-run relative frequency</em>. For instance, the probability of a coin flip landing on heads is defined as the proportion of times a coin lands heads when I flip a coin for a very, very large number of times. Table <a href="statistical-modelling.html#tab:long-run-frequency-table">2.1</a> shows the outcome and relative frequency calculations for 15 coin flips.</p>

<p>As you can see, the relative frequency fluctuates quite a bit, but becomes more stable with more flips. But even after 5000 flips, it is not equal to 0.5. Flipping a coin can be viewed as an experiment, that we can repeat. Figure <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:coin-flip-relative-frequency-multiple">2.2</a> shows the results of flipping a coin for 5000 times when repeating the experiment for 5 times. As you can see, the results of our experiments (the relative frequencies) are different each time. The differences are quite marked for a small number of flips, but become more alike after flipping the coin more times. This illustrates something known as <strong>The Law of Large Numbers</strong>, to which we will come back soon. For now, let’s focus on a different matter. If probability is a relative frequency, then which one is it? Each repetition of the experiment, as well as each number of throws, would give us a different answer!</p>

<p>To give a single answer, a “long-run relative frequency” must be the relative frequency when flipping the coin for an infinite number of times. That may seem disappointing. A nice aspect of the Frequentist View is that probabilities are something of the real world, but surely, we can’t flip a coin for an infinite number of times in the real world. That is true, but to understand what probability is, we don’t necessarily have to perform such infinite experiments. When we have to estimate the probability from a given (non-infinite) number of coin flips, we do have to worry about these issues. This, indeed, is what statistics is about: dealing with sample variability to estimate and infer unknown things. But for defining what a probability is, we can use mathematics to show that the long run relative frequency converges to a single number as the number of coin flips gets closer and closer to infinity. Which, in other words, means there is a single long-run relative frequency, and hence the probability is mathematically well-defined.</p>
<p>There is an alternative to the Frequentist View, called the <strong>Bayesian view</strong> or <strong>Subjective view</strong>, according to which probability means a <em>rational degree of belief</em>. This, in a sense, takes probability out of the real world, and into our minds. By doing so, it allows statements of probabilities for single events, such as what is the probability that it will rain tomorrow. In the Frequentist View, it either rains tomorrow or not. We can ask what the probability is that it rains on the 25th of July, by considering the long-run relative frequency of rain on every 25th of July in the past, present, and future. But there is no long-run relative frequency for the 25th of July 2020.</p>
<div id="the-rules-of-probability" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> The rules of probability</h4>
<!-- https://bolt.mph.ufl.edu/6050-6052/unit-3/module-6/ -->
<!-- https://bolt.mph.ufl.edu/6050-6052/unit-3/module-7/ -->
<p>Although the interpretation of probability is debated, the mathematical rules of calculating probabilities are generally agreed upon. Suppose we have an outcome space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S} = \{E_1, E_2, E_3, \ldots\}\)</span>. That is, the outcome space consists of (abstract) events <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span>, etc. To refer to any of these, we can use the notation <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can equal 1, 2, 3, etc.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(0 \leq P(E_i) \leq 1\)</span>. The probability of any event <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> is greater or equal to 0 and smaller than or equal to 1. This rule requires little further explanation. Probabilities are chosen to lie on a scale between 0 and 1.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(E_1 \text{ or } E_2 \text{ or } E_3 \text{ or } \ldots) = P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\)</span>. In words, this means that the probability of at least one event in the outcome space occurring is 1.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_j\)</span> are <em>mutually exclusive</em> events (if one of them occurs, the other cannot occur), then <span class="math inline">\(P(E_i \text{ or } E_j) = P(E_i) + P(E_j)\)</span>. This is also called the <strong>sum rule</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(\neg E_i) = 1 - P(E_i)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math inline">\(\neg\)</span> means “not”, so the probability of “not <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span>” is 1 minus the probability of <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> occurring. This is also called the <strong>complement rule</strong>.</li>
<li>For any events <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(E_i \text{ or } E_j) = P(E_i) + P(E_j) - P(E_i \text{ and } E_j)\)</span>. This rule holds whether the events are mutually exclusive or not, and can be called the <strong>general sum rule</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, all these rules seem overkill when we are dealing with a simple coin flip. So let’s consider a slightly more complex situation: betting on the outcome a roll of a six-sided die. In this betting game, like in roulette, you are allowed to bet on many things, such as the exact number, but also whether the number is odd or even, whether the number is greater than 3, whether the number is greater smaller than 1, etc. All these things are events in the outcome space:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{S} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \text{even}, \text{odd}, &gt;3, &lt; 1, \geq 4, 1 \text{ or } 3, \ldots \}\]</span></p>
<p>The first six events in this outcome space (the numbers 1 to 6) are called <strong>elementary events</strong>: they are mutually exclusive (a single roll cannot result in both a 1 and a 3), and one of them <em>must</em> occur. So we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6) = 1\)</span>. But wait, there are more events in the outcome space, and <span class="math inline">\(P(\mathcal{S}) = 1\)</span>, and these six events are only a small part of the outcome space, so does that imply that they all have probability 0? No! That is because not all events in the outcome space are mutually exclusive. For instance, if the outcome is 5, then the outcome is also odd, and it is also <span class="math inline">\(&gt;3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\geq 4\)</span>, etc. As you might have noticed, the other events are actually themselves sets of the elementary events. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(\text{odd} = \{1, 3, 5\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\text{even} = \{2, 4, 6\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 3 = \{4, 5, 6 \}\)</span>. Figure <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:euler-diagram-betting-die">2.3</a> depicts the relations between these events, as well as the elementary events.</p>

</div>
<p>We just really need one more rule and then we’re done. This rule is to compute the probability of a conjunction of events (the probability of both events occurring). To be able to state this rule, we first need to consider the concept of <strong>conditional probability</strong>. In words, such a probability refers to the probability of one event <em>given that another event occurred</em>. For instance, we can consider the probability of the event “greater than 3” given that the event “odd” occurred (i.e., the probability that the outcome was greater than 3 given that the outcome was an odd number). If we know that the outcome was odd (i.e. 1, 3, or 5), we can rule out all occurrences where the outcome was even (i.e. 2, 4, or 6). To now consider the probability that the outcome was greater than 3, we only need the probability of an outcome greater than 3 within the set of odd numbers. If we are sure that the outcome was odd, we can set <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{odd}|\text{odd}) = 1\)</span>. There are three outcomes, each with equal probability, so <span class="math inline">\(P(1|\text{odd}) = P(3|\text{odd}) = P(5|\text{odd}) = \frac{1}{3}\)</span>. In the set of odd outcomes, there is only one number greater than 3, namely 5. That means that the conditional probability <span class="math inline">\(P(&gt;3|\text{odd}) = P(5|\text{odd}) = \frac{1}{3}\)</span>. Conversely, we can also work out the conditional probability <span class="math inline">\(P(\leq 3| = P(5|\text{odd})) = P(1|\text{odd}) + P(3|\text{odd}) = \frac{2}{3}\)</span>. In a sense, a conditional probability is just looking at the relative occurrence of one event <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> (e.g., the event “<span class="math inline">\(&gt;3\)</span>”) within the set of outcomes defined by another event (e.g., the event “odd”).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(E_i|E_j) = \frac{P(E_i \text{ and } E_j) }{P(E_j)}\]</span></p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(E_i \text{ and } E_j) = P(E_i) \times P(E_j | E_i)\)</span>. <strong>Multiplication rule</strong></li>
<li>For two <strong>independent</strong> events <span class="math inline">\(E_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(E_i \text{ and } E_j) = P(E_i) \times P(E_j)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Kolmogorov, a rather brilliant mathematician, showed that you only need rules 1, 2 and 3; all the other rules follow from the first three. In mathematical terms, rules 1, 2, and 3 are <em>axioms</em>, statements which we assume are true without being able to prove them, while the remaining rules are <em>theorems</em>, statements which follow from the axioms and can be proven to be true.</p>

<div id="a-model-of-flipping-an-unbiased-coin" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.2</span> A model of flipping an unbiased coin</h4>
<p>Now that we know more about probability, let’s get back to our model for Paul. With a balanced coin (and a not too cunning flipper), the probability of the coin landing heads should equal the probability of the coin landing tails. In mathematical notation, we can state this as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{heads}) = P(\text{tails})\]</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, as heads and tails the only two possible outcomes, we know that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{heads} \text{ or } \text{tails}) = 1\]</span>
Finally, because heads and tails are two mutually exclusive events, we then infer that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\text{heads}) = P(\text{tails}) = 0.5,\]</span>
and given the way Paul bases his decisions on this coin flip, also that
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{paul left}) = P(\text{paul right}) = 0.5.\]</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, if Paul made his decision for the left or right box by flipping a coin, it doesn’t really matter whether the team representing the left or right box was chosen randomly, or in some other way. Suppose that Paul’s keeper was very knowledgeable about football, or that he was the real psychic. Furthermore, let’s suppose that he thinks Paul might generally prefer the right box (as the light is particularly nice on that side of the tank, for instance). Then <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{winner right}) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{winner left}) = 0\)</span>. Because Paul’s decisions are independent from which team was placed in which box (he’s merely flipping a coin), we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{paul left} | \text{winner left}) = P(\text{paul left})\)</span>, and similarly <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{paul right} | \text{winner left}) = P(\text{paul right})\)</span>. There are two ways in which Paul can make a correct prediction: he opens the right box, and the winning team was in the right box, or he opens the left box and the winning team was in the left box. So
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{correct}) = P(\text{paul left} \text{ and } \text{winner left}) + P(\text{paul right} \text{ and } \text{winner right})\]</span>
Using the multiplication rule, we can write this as
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{correct}) = P(\text{paul left} | \text{winner left}) \times P(\text{winner left}) + \\ P(\text{paul right} | \text{winner right}) \times P(\text{winner right})\]</span>
And from the independence between Paul’s decisions and the assignment of teams to boxes, we can simplify this further as
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{correct}) = P(\text{paul left}) \times P(\text{winner left}) + P(\text{paul right}) \times P(\text{winner right})\]</span>
which, filling in the appropriate values, becomes
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{correct}) = .5 \times 0 + .5 \times 1 = .5\]</span>
Actually, you can fill in any valid probability for <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{winner left})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{winner right})\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{correct})\)</span> will always be .5! Let’s say, in abstract terms, that <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{winning left}) = \theta\)</span>. From the complement rule, we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{winning right}) = 1 - \theta\)</span>. Then
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
P(\text{correct}) &amp;= P(\text{paul left}) \times \theta + P(\text{paul right}) \times (1-\theta) \\
&amp;= .5 \times \theta +  .5 \times (1-\theta) \\
&amp;= .5 \times \theta - .5 \times \theta + .5\\
&amp;= .5
\end{align}\]</span>
So according to our model, no matter what bias Paul’s keeper might have in placing winning teams in the left or right box, Paul’s accuracy for each prediction would be <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{correct}) = .5\)</span>.</p>
<!--
$$P(\text{correct}) = P(\text{incorrect}) = 0.5$$

$$P(\texttt{prediction}_i = \text{correct}) = P(\texttt{prediction}_i = \text{incorrect}) = 0.5$$

$$P(Y_i = \text{correct}) = P(Y_i = \text{incorrect}) = 0.5$$

which you can translate into words as 

> The probability that observation $i$ of variable $Y$ equals 'correct' is identical to the probability that observation $i$ of variable $Y$ equals 'incorrect', and both equal 0.5.

<div id="distributions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Distributions</h3>
<p>A probability distribution, as the name suggests, defines how probability is distributed over all possible values of a variable. You can think of “all probability” as a pie, and the probability distribution as slicing up the pie in (possibly unequal) pieces. Each possible value of a variable is given its own slice, and the size of the slice relative to the overall pie is the probability. Looking at the correctness of a single prediction, the pie is divided into two equal slices: half for <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{correct})\)</span>, and the other half for <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{incorrect})\)</span>. But Paul made more than one prediction (8 in the case of the FIFA 2010 World Cup), and what we’re really interested in is Paul’s accuracy in all his predictions: What is the probability that Paul made 8 out of 8 correct predictions if he was merely guessing? Using the rules of probability, we can work out this probability as well.</p>
<p>According to our coin-flipping model, it does not matter which of Paul’s prediction we look at (e.g. whether the first, the second, the last, or any other one). In fact, we could generate the data in the reverse order, or start with the Germany-Australia match and then the Spain-Germany match. Let’s write Paul’s predictions as a variable <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{pred}_i\)</span>, where the index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> can be a value between 1 and 8, corresponding to the first, second, <em>etc</em>, prediction he made. The probability that any prediction is correct is <span class="math inline">\(P(\texttt{pred}_i = \text{correct}) = .5\)</span>, and whether that prediction is correct is independent from whether any earlier (or later) prediction is correct. In fancy terms, this means that the observations <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> are <em>independent and identically distributed</em> (IID).</p>
<p>When considering the probability of a sequence of events (e.g. a consecutive run of 8 correct predictions), it can be useful to draw all possible outcomes in the form of a tree. In Figure <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:heads-tails-tree">2.4</a>, we show such a tree for the first three of Paul’s predictions according to our model in which he was randomly guessing. Starting at the “root node” on the left, the first guess can be either correct or incorrect, and these two outcomes are represented as separate branches. If the first guess was correct, we take the “Cor” branch. The next guess can be either correct or incorrect, which splits this branch into two further branches, and so forth.</p>

Figure 2.4: Outcome tree for three random guesses.
</p>
</div>
<p>For three coin flips, there are 8 unique sequences of outcomes (the tree ends in 8 branches). Because the probability of “heads” and “tails” are identical, and each coin flip is independent of the others, each unique sequence such as “Cor, Cor, Inc” has exactly the same probability, namely <span class="math inline">\(0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = (0.5)^3 = 0.125\)</span>. However, if we are not interested in the probability of a unique sequence of outcomes, but rather the total number of correct guesses, the corresponding probabilities are not equal. For example, there is only one sequence in which the number of correct guesses is 3, but there are three sequences in which the number of correct guesses equals 2. Each of these sequences has the sample probability, so we can just add these up
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{2 correct and 1 incorrect}) = 3 \times 0.125 = 0.375\]</span>
Similarly, the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{1 Cor 2 Inc}) = 0.375\)</span>, as there are three sequences in which the number of correct guesses equals 1.</p>
<p>Note that we have used a distribution over the outcomes of a single variable (a single prediction) to effectively construct three variables (<span class="math inline">\(\texttt{pred}_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{pred}_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{pred}_3\)</span>) reflecting Pauls first, second, and third prediction, respectively. We can take the outcomes of each of these three variables and turn this into a new variable reflecting the outcome of all three predictions. This new variable has 8 possible outcomes (unique sequences), each with an equal probability of occurring. Finally, we can then use this sequence variable to construct yet a new variable, the one we are really interested in, reflecting the number of correct predictions. This variable (in the case of three predictions), has four unique outcomes (0, 1, 2, or 3 correct) with <em>unequal</em> probabilities. Perhaps all these variables make your head spin. But a main thing to realize is that from a quite simple model of the Data Generating Process (the outcome of each prediction is an independent coin flip), we can start to say something about how likely Paul’s performance of 8 out of 8 correct predictions really was.</p>
To work out the probability distribution of the number of correct predictions out of 8, we could expand the tree of <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:heads-tails-tree">2.4</a>, but the tree would become very large. There is a simpler way to count the number of sequences with a particular number of correct predictions in them. The number of sequences of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> predictions where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> predictions are correct can be computed as
<span class="math display">\[\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} ,\]</span>
where the exclamation mark refers to the so-called factorial function, where a positive integer is multiplied by all positive integers which are smaller than it. So
<span class="math display">\[n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times (n-3) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1\]</span>
So we can write

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Flipping a biased coin: An alternative model</h2>
<p>Suppose that Paul did not make his decisions by flipping a mental coin. Perhaps Paul had extensive knowledge of all things football, or perhaps he could see into the future. In that case, we might expect Paul to have a higher rate of correct answers than predicted by our coin flipping model. But perhaps Paul, although an oracle, wasn’t so benevolent to his caretakers, or didn’t want to spoil the match for them. In that case, we might expect the rate of correct answers to be lower than predicted by the coin flipping model. In both case, we’d expect the probability of a correct answer to be different from .5: <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{correct}) \neq .5\)</span>. But whilst not .5, we don’t otherwise know the value. We call such an unknown value which determines a probability distribution a <strong>parameter</strong>. We will generally use symbols from the Greek alphabet to denote such parameters. Here, we will use <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> (pronounced as “thee-ta”). Our alternative to the coin flipping model can now be stated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(\texttt{pred}_i = \text{correct}) = \theta\]</span></p>
<p>Like a <em>variable</em>, a parameter such as <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> can take different values. It belongs to a model, and its value can not be observed, only inferred. As our parameter reflects a probability, we know that it can never be lower than 0, and never larger than 1. So we know that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[0 \leq \theta \leq 1 .\]</span></p>
<!-- ("zero is less than or equal to $\theta$, which is less than or equal to 1").-->
<p>Note that the possible values in this range includes <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 0.5\)</span>. Our (unbiased) coin flipping model is actually one of the possible versions (a “special case”) of our new, more general model. Some other ways of saying this are that the coin flipping model is contained within, or nested under, the more general new model. As we will see, <strong>nested models</strong> play an important role in statistical modelling. In particular, we will often compare how well a special-case or nested model describes the data compared to a more general model. In such model comparisons, we will usually refer to the special-case model as <strong>MODEL S</strong>, and the more general model as <strong>MODEL G</strong>. It is important to realise that these names (like variables) are containers and we can put any models in these, as long as the one we put into MODEL S is a special case of the one we put into MODEL G.</p>
<p>To work out the probability of the number of correct predictions according to this model, we can draw a similar tree as in Figure <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:heads-tails-tree">2.4</a>, but instead of the probability of each branch being 0.5, we’d use <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> for any branch that leads to correct, and <span class="math inline">\(1-\theta\)</span> for any branch leading to incorrect. That means that the probability of a particular sequence, such as “Cor, Inc, Cor” is not <span class="math inline">\((0.5)^{3}\)</span>, but rather <span class="math inline">\(\theta \times (1-\theta) \times \theta = \theta^2 \times (1-\theta)\)</span>. Apart from this, the logic of constructing the probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> correct predictions is the same, and can be computed as
<span class="math display" id="eq:definition-binomial-distribution">\[\begin{equation}
P(k \text { correct and }  n-k \text{ incorrect}) = \frac{n!}{k! \times (n-k)!} (\theta)^k \times (1-\theta)^{(n-k)}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
This distribution is quite common in statistics, and is called the <strong>Binomial distribution</strong>. Note that if we fill in <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 0.5\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((1-\theta) = 0.5\)</span> and the resulting distribution is exactly the one we worked out for the unbiased coin-flipping model earlier. So our new, more general model can indeed exactly produce the distribution of the simpler model, and this is what we mean when we say that the simpler model is nested under the more general model.</p>
<p>To work out the probability that Paul made 8 out of 8 correct predictions according this new model, we need to know the value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. But what should this be? There are infinite possible values that might be reasonable (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .9\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .947873\)</span>). Luckily, we don’t need to pluck one of these values out of thin air: we can use the data we have to estimate the value of this parameter.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Estimation</h2>
<!-- 
From data produced by the Data Generating Process (DGP), we can estimate the value of a parameter. Remember, when we collect data in real life, it is obtained from DGP. Our model, on the other hand, provides a mathematical abstraction of the DGP. The DGP is The Truth. It is how the real world generated the data. Our model, on the other hand, is almost surely an approximation to The Truth. Think about it. Can you summarize Paul's choices by a mathematical formula with a distribution that takes a single parameter ($\theta$)? Probably not when you see Paul swimming in his tank, catching a glimmer of light shining from one of the boxes, than being distracted by the sound of a distant door opening, then going back and sensing a vibration in the water. How would all these serendipitous things not affect Paul's decision at the time? Our model ignores all these factors, and for a reason. Imagine we had to take all sensory input of Paul into account. We would not only have to take into account the actual stimuli present at the time, but also how they affected Paul's neuronal reactions to those. Even if we only take into account the neurons responding directly to external input, the number of possible neuronal excitation patterns quickly become enormous. When you think about it, you'd also want to take into account the activation state of all the neurons at the time just before (and possibly before that), which makes the number of possibilities even more enormous. And what about the chemical consistency of the water at the time? Learning a model of particular decision by a particular person at a particular time seems simply impossible without assuming that some of these things don't really matter to the decision at hand.

So we can view our biased coin-flipping model as a simplification, but potentially useful model of Paul's accuracy if he was (somewhat) psychic. 
-->
<p>Estimation, in some sense, means an “educated guess”. It is a guess, because we cannot be completely sure that we have picked the true value. It is educated because we don’t just pluck the value from thin air: we use information in the data to guide our guess.</p>
<div id="maximum-likelihood-estimation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Maximum likelihood estimation</h3>
<p>It can be summarized as follows: Find the value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> such that the probability assigned to the data at hand by the model is highest.</p>
<p>Let’s think this through. If we pick any particular value for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, we can use the Binomial distribution (Equation <a href="statistical-modelling.html#eq:definition-binomial-distribution">(2.1)</a>) to work out the probability that Paul made 8 out of 8 predictions. For instance, if we pick <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .4\)</span>, then
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
P(\text{8 correct and 0 incorrect}) &amp;= \frac{8!}{8!0!} (0.4)^8 \times (0.6)^0 \\
&amp;= 1 \times (0.4)^8 \times 1 = 0.000655
\end{align}\]</span>
If we pick <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .95\)</span>, on the other hand, we’d get
<span class="math display">\[P(\text{8 correct and 0 incorrect}) = 1 \times (0.95)^8 \times 1 = 0.663\]</span>
which is obviously higher. If we plot <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{8 correct} | \theta)\)</span>, the probability of 8 correct <em>given</em> or <em>conditional upon</em> a particular value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, for all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, we get the curve shown in Figure <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:plot-likelihood-fifa2010">2.6</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Looking at this plot, is it obvious that the probability of Paul’s observed performance is highest in the model with <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 1\)</span>, thus, our maximum likelihood estimate becomes <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} = 1\)</span>. As can be shown mathematically, the maximum likelihood estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> for our model and any data set with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> correct out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is <em>always</em>
<span class="math display" id="eq:maximum-likelihood-estimator-binomial">\[\begin{equation}

i.e. equal to the proportion of correct. Estimating a probability as a proportion seems intuitively reasonable. But how good is it really?</p>
</div>
<div id="properties-of-good-estimators" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Properties of good estimators</h3>
<p>An <strong>estimator</strong> like specified in Equation <a href="statistical-modelling.html#eq:maximum-likelihood-estimator-binomial">(2.2)</a> is an algorithm which takes data as input and produces a parameter estimate as output. Evaluating the quality of the resulting estimates is generally done under the assumption that our model represents the Data Generating Process accurately, i.e. our model is a true representation of the DGP. If our model has unknown parameters, that means that there are values for those parameters such that our model produces data with exactly the same distribution as the DGP. We can call those parameter values the true parameter values. Now, even if we have access to such a true model, estimates of its parameters from a given data set are unlikely to be identical to the true parameters. The main reason is that any actual data set will not cover all of the values that are possible from the Data Generating Process, and/or not in their expected proportions. But the fact is that in practice we have to rely on such limited data sets; we never have access to all the data that could be produced by the Data Generating Process. So we will have to work with estimates that are different from the true parameters. One thing we can do is quantify how much our estimates are likely to deviate from the true parameters. This, in a nutshell, is what statistical estimation theory is all about.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in Equation @(eq:maximum-likelihood-estimator-binomial) a bit more. For any fixed sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and a particular true value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, the variability in the estimates will be completely determined by the variability in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the number correct. The variability in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> directly follows from the Binomial distribution itself. If you look at the distribution depicted in Figure <a href="#distribution-8-coin-flips-correct"><strong>??</strong></a>, which is the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .5\)</span>, you can see there are 9 possible values for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and hence also 9 possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{k}{n}\)</span>, the estimator of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. So when the true <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .5\)</span>, when we generate a new data set of 8 predictions, it is possible that the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> will equal any value <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\frac{0}{8}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{2}{8}, \ldots, \frac{7}{8}, \frac{8}{8}\right\}\)</span>, because in this new data set, the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> can be any value between 0 and 8. Exactly like the values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, not each of these estimates will be equally likely. For most of the new data sets, the estimate will equal <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} = frac{4}{8}\)</span>, the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. If the true <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 1\)</span>, then there would be no variability in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. It is simply impossible to make a wrong prediction, and hence the estimate would always equal the true value. In this case, how variable the estimates are depends on the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. There is no variability whenever <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 1\)</span>, and the variability increases the closer <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> gets to .5.</p>
<p>Because in this case, the variability in the estimates depends on the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, which is unknown and the reason we have to estimate this parameter in the first place, we cannot easily say how far off we might expect our estimate to be from the true parameter. Nevertheless, we can still assess how good our estimator is by considering some important properties good estimators in general: unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency.</p>
<p>An <strong>unbiased</strong> estimator gives, on average, estimates which are equal to the true parameter.</p>
<p>A good estimator should become more precise as we have more data. The larger the number of observations from the Data Generating Process, the closer the resulting estimates should be to the true parameters. A <strong>consistent</strong> estimator is one which provides less variable estimates if we give it more data.</p>
<p>An <strong>efficient</strong> estimator is an estimator which provides the least possible variable estimates, meaning it is the most consistent possible. Variability in estimates is unavoidable, as data sets are always limited samples from the Data Generating Process. It can be proven mathematically that there a variance of the estimates that no unbiased estimator can go below, or no biased estimator with a given level of bias can go below. An estimator for which the variance in the estimates is equal to this lower bound is called efficient. Such an estimator is, in some sense, the Holy Grail of statistical estimation, especially an unbiased one.</p>
<p>In general, maximum likelihood estimators are consistent and (asymptotically) efficient. They are not always unbiased though, although the bias (the difference between the mean estimate and the true value) decreases when the number of observations increases. Given these desirable properties, maximum likelihood estimators are often the estimators of choice.</p>

</div>
<div id="null-hypothesis-significance-testing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Null-hypothesis significance testing</h2>
<p>So, at this point, we have three models of Paul’s accuracy in predictions. The biased coin-flipping model with an unknown parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. The unbiased coin-flipping, or random guessing, model (which is a special case of the first one, with <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 0.5\)</span>). And an <em>estimated</em> version of the biased coin-flipping model, with <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} = 1\)</span> (which is also a special case). Now what?</p>
<p>What we would like to know is whether Paul was randomly guessing, or whether he had some psychic abilities. In other words, whether the unbiased coin-flipping model or the biased coin-flipping model provides a better description of the Data Generating Process. While it is reasonable to define a model as providing a better description of the DGP when the distribution it proposes is a better match to the true DGP distribution, this definition is not usable in practice, as we simply don’t know the true DGP distribution. We have to work with the data at hand, and there are many possible ways in which we can use the data to evaluate whether one statistical model to provide a better description of the DGP. On principled way is to compare the probability assigned to the observed data by each model. This is usually done by computing what is called the likelihood ratio. Suppose we have two versions of the general biased-coin flipping model, one where we assume that the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> has a particular value <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta}\)</span>, and one where we assume <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> takes a different specified value <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta}&#39;\)</span>. Note that by placing a “tilde” over a parameter, we denote that it is a particular value of interest. In this case, we are interested in a single variable, namely the number of correct predictions Paul made, which we will denote by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, our general symbol for the dependent variable. We can then write the likelihood ratio as:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{P(Y = k | n, \theta = \tilde{\theta})}{P(Y = k | n, \theta = \tilde{\theta}&#39;)}\]</span>
At the top (the <em>numerator</em>), is the probability of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> correct when the probability of a single prediction correct equals <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta}\)</span>. The bottom part (the <em>denominator</em>), is the same probability if the probability of a single correct prediction equals another value <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta}\)</span>’. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta} = .5\)</span> (as in the random guessing model), and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta}&#39; = 1\)</span>, as in the <em>estimated</em> biased coin-tossing model. The likelihood ratio is then
<span class="math display">\[\frac{P(Y = 8 | n = 8, \theta = 0.5)}{P(Y = 8 | n = 8, \theta = 1)} = \frac{0.00391}{1} = 0.00391\]</span>
What does this mean? Well, if both models assigned the same probability to the observed data, the likelihood ratio would equal one. If the probability according to the model of the numerator is higher, the value of the likelihood ratio would be <em>greater</em> than 1. And if the probability according to the model of the denominator is higher, the value of the likelihood ratio would be <em>smaller</em> than 1. So, as is clear, the model with the estimated value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> assigns a higher probability to the observed data. But that is no wonder! We estimated <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> by maximum likelihood, meaning that no other value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> could assign a higher probability to the data! If it did, our estimate would simply <em>not</em> be the maximum likelihood estimate. So, if the model in the denominator is the one estimated by maximum likelihood, we know the likelihood ratio could <em>never</em> be larger than 1.</p>
<p>So that’s a little annoying. What seemed like a reasonable way to compare two models describe a particular data set, now seems pretty useless. We cannot use the general biased coin-flipping model to compute the likelihood ratio, because without choosing a particular value for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, the model can not be used to compute the probability of the data. And we can not just use the estimated value of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, because then that model would always win the “likelihood competition”. But computing likelihood ratio’s is not, in fact, completely useless. We just need to take into account the fact that the estimated model will always win. What then matters is: by how much?</p>
<p>The null-hypothesis significance test provides an answer to “by how much should the estimated model be better to refute an alternative model?”. The logic is roughly as follows: Suppose the restricted model (MODEL R, e.g. the one where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\theta} = .5\)</span>) is the true model. Then we can use this model to simulate lots of data sets. For each data set, we can estimate <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to give us an estimated version of the general model (i.e. MODEL G, the one with <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> unknown). Then we can use both models to compute a value of the likelihood ratio. For each data set, the likelihood ratio may take a different value. What we end up with is thus a distribution of values of the likelihood ratio, produced by MODEL R. We will know that this likelihood ratio is always below 1, but by inspecting this distribution, we will roughly know what the usual values are, in the case where MODEL R is true. We can then try to find a range of values which are relatively <em>unusual</em>, given that MODEL R is true. If the value of the likelihood ratio we found for the real data is within this range, we might reason that this value is “unusual enough” to reject MODEL R, and accept that MDOEL G provides a better description.</p>
<p>So let’s do this. I used MODEL R (the one with <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .5\)</span>) to simulate 100,000 data sets in which Paul made 8 predictions. For each of these, I estimated MODEL G, and then computed the likelihood ratio for that dataset. I then determined the proportion (out of all 100,000) simulations of each value of the likelihood ratio
<span class="math display">\[\frac{P(Y = k | n = 8, \theta = 0.5)}{P(Y = k | n = 8, \theta = \frac{k}{8})}\]</span>
Note that <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the main thing that varies from simulated dataset to simulated dataset, and that for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the model of the denominator, I have filled in the maximum likelihood estimate <span class="math inline">\(\frac{k}{8}\)</span>, which also varies over the simulations. You can see the result in Figure <a href="statistical-modelling.html#fig:simulate-LR-coin-flipping">2.7</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:simulate-LR-coin-flipping"></span>
<img src="_main_files/figure-html/simulate-LR-coin-flipping-1.svg" alt="Likelihood ratio values for 100,000 simulated data sets from MODEL R with $\theta = .5$" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.7: Likelihood ratio values for 100,000 simulated data sets from MODEL R with <span class="math inline">\(\theta = .5\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>A first thing to notice is that there are only 5 unique values of the likelihood ratio in all 100,000 simulations. This is not a strange coincidence. While there are 9 possible values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for datasets with <span class="math inline">\(n=8\)</span>, some of these will provide exactly the same likelihood ratio. For example, the likelihood ratio is identical for <span class="math inline">\(k=3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=5\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\frac{P(Y = 3 | n = 8, \theta = 0.5)}{P(Y = 3 | n = 8, \theta = \frac{3}{8})} = \frac{P(Y = 5 | n = 8, \theta = 0.5)}{P(Y = 5 | n = 8, \theta = \frac{5}{8})} = 0.777\]</span>
Similarly, the value of the likelihood ratio is identical for <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=6\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=7\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=8\)</span>. With that out of the way, let’s look at how often each of these 5 values occurred. As MODEL R was the true model (we used it as the Data Generating Process for our simulations), you might expect that a likelihood ratio of 1 would be the most frequent value, as that would imply that MODEL R and (estimated) MODEL G provide an equally good description of a data set. But while this value occurs relatively frequently (27.45%), the most common value is actually 2.158 (43.694%). Only the value of 0.00391 is rather unlikely (0.735%). In all our simulations, less than 1% had a value of the likelihood ratio as low as the one we found for the real data. If MODEL R is true, we would not expect an estimated MODEL G as well very often. But is that reasonable grounds to conclude MODEL G provides a better description than the random-guessing MODEL R?</p>

## Exercises

1. Maybe Paul has a preference to go to the right hand container. 
    a. Suppose Paul always opens the right container first. So $P(\text{Paul chooses right}) = 1.0$. Furthermore, suppose that his keeper has ability to predict the winner of a match, in that he is correct on 60% of his predictions, i.e. $P(\text{keeper is correct}) = .6$. Finally, let's suppose that the keeper wants to help Paul, so he always puts the flag of the country he predicts to win on the right container. What is the probability that Paul's "predictions" are correct? And what if Paul's spatial preference was less marked at $P(\text{Paul chooses right}) = .6$?
